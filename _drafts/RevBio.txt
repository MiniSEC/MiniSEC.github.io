Scholars and Philosophers have already covered much of the life of the Rev. Richard E. Baker, but in case you haven't read their exhaustive works let us summarize: Known by many names. Ordained by the Church of Latter-Day Dude. Born in the lush hills of North Carolina, and relocated at a young age to the cultural mecca of Fresno California. Rev was raised in the warm and nurturing arms of CRT screen's and forums of BBS's. Rev is a lover BBQ, Bacon, and all great food (but not banana's; those are for providing a measurement reference not eating!). Tinkering and the essence of hacking has always been with Rev. Computers to over-unity, Rev plays with it all. Consulting all over for over 10 years, government to fortune 500, finally landing in the Bay Area and looking forward to joining the Tagged family.
