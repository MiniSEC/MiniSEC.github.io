I must not fear.<br>
Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
I will face my fear.<br>
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br>
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br>
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br>
Only I will remain.<br>
