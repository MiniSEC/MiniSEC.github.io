> Before I studied the art, a punch was a punch, A kick just a kick.
> After I learned the art, a punch was no longer a punch, a kick no longer a kick.
> Now that I UNDERSTAND the art, a punch is just a punch, a kick is just a kick.
> The height of cultivation is nothing special...
> It is merely simplicity: The ability to do the utmost with the minimum.
