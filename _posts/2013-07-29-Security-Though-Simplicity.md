> After I learned the art, a punch was no longer a punch, a kick no longer a kick. <br>
> Now that I UNDERSTAND the art, a punch is just a punch, a kick is just a kick. <br>
> The height of cultivation is nothing special... <br>
> It is merely simplicity: The ability to do the utmost with the minimum. <br>
