Simplicity is difficult start calling ourselves Subject Matter Experts, we have a need to make sure we seem "above". That we have learned the arts that we practice day to day, but because technology moves so fast, few can be truly called Masters. I do not say this lightly, as I am one of those who lives the SME life. I find myself asking over and over, Why do we allow the mistakes of the past to perpetuate to the future?. Why we continue to do what we know fails.
