    <div id="notes" class="opacity">Charles Xavier is asleep yet his mind stirs with restlessness. All of the tragedies that the X-Men had to deal with in recent times have stressed him, the latest in this chain of events being his erasing of Magneto&#226;??s mind. In his dream, Xavier is questioned by his subconsciousness that takes on the shape of his archenemy and former friend Eric Lehnsherr, Magneto. He tells Eric that for some reason he resents Scott and Jean because they have found happiness despite all the tragedies that the team has experienced. Revisiting several important events in his life, the two of them reach the core of Xavier&#226;??s problems. Growing up to see his mother get abused by his stepfather, Charles Xavier has always been trying to make up for the fact that he was unable to help her. That was why he started a relationship with Gabrielle Haller, but ended it when she no longer needed him. Apparently he did not have any intact relationship, Moira was only with him out of scientific curiosity, and later left him for another man, while Lilandra, the ruler of the Shi&#226;??Ar Empire, is far away. Xavier however brings up Amelia Voght as a different example. He met the nurse in India, after his legs had been crushed and he could no longer walk. Amelia snapped him out of his depression, and they started a relationship. Only after a while they both discovered that the other one was a mutant too. Unfortunately their different views drove a wedge between them. While Xavier proceeded to search for young mutants to help them to learn how to use their power, as surely Magneto would be gathering forces too, Amelia thought that an organization like the X-Men would only draw unwanted attention, and it were better if mutants remained in hiding. The night he took in Scott Summers, Amelia left the mansion. On her way out, Charles briefly used his telepathy on her to force her to see his point of view, but realizing his error he immediately let go. Still the deed was done, and Amelia never spoke to him again until recently when he saw her again among Magneto&#226;??s Acolytes. With this dark secret admitted, Xavier is now ready to face his life again, and he concludes that despite himself abusing his power that day, he is still far from being like Magneto. The manifestation of his subconsciousness agrees, and says that he now might realize that one can have both, follow his goal and find personal happiness, just like Scott and Jean.</div>
