    <div id="notes" class="opacity">Juggernaut swims in the lake near Cyclops&#226;?? and Phoenix&#226;??s home. He is waiting for them to return home. He triggers an alarm in the mansion. Back at the mansion Bishop and Gambit to go check out the alarm. They confront Juggernaut and are quickly beaten by him. Cyclops&#226;?? Danger Room training session is interrupted by a frightened Phoenix who just had an encounter with Onslaught on the psionic plane. As time goes by, her memory of the event dims, but she remembers Onslaught asking her to join him. Later, Phoenix returns home only to find Gambit and Bishop dumped on her front porch by Juggernaut who convinces her he came here to help. He claims to have the secret of Onslaught locked in his head and he says he needs her help to unlock it. Phoenix takes Juggernaut on a long walk to the bottom levels of the mansion. She takes him to a psi-shielded chamber so they can discover the answer of the question: Who is Onslaught? Meanwhile, Xavier meets with Sam in his study. Sam is feeling ineffective as a member of the X-Men team and is thinking about quitting. Xavier basically tells him to quit his whining and either leave or get back to work. In the infirmary, the Dark Beast examines Wolverine while Storm and Iceman look on. Beast tells Wolverine he needs to run more tests, and Wolverine gets of the table and runs away in anger saying he has other resources. Storm decides to go after Wolverine but ends up talking to Cannonball about the Professor&#226;??s behavior. Xavier summons Scott to a meeting in the War room. Xavier tells Scott that he is disappointed with him on many different levels. Then he tells Scott he needs him to be strong for all of them. When Scott reaches out to touch Xavier he discovers that he has been talking to a holographic projection. Scott tries to find Xavier through the computer only to be told that Xavier is in his study where he has been for the past 48 hours. Cyclops comes to the conclusion that he was undergoing some sort of test to teach him to be prepared for anything. In Colorado, Archangel and Psylocke try to contact the mansion. Neither of them is successful so they decide on a trip to Westchester. In New Hampshire, Creed meets with Bastion after he finishes a speaking engagement. Bastion wonders to himself what his supporters would do if they knew Creeds parents were Mystique and Sabretooth. Bastion tells Creed he has a great plan, and Creed should count himself lucky that Senator Kelly survived the assassination attempt.</div>
